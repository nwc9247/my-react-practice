# My React Practice Project

This is a practice React project where I learned:

- How to create React components
- Using props and JSX
- Styling components with CSS
- Mapping arrays to display lists

## Components

- **Button**: A reusable button component
- **Product**: A product list component
- **About**: A about component
- **ProductCard**: This component receives title, image, and price as props to display product details dynamically.
- **ProductList**: This component uses api call, used async function and make a card that contains title, and price.
